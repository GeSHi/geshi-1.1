get-keywords.php is a script to get a current list of all the keywords for a particular language.

Currently it's very alpha, just like the rest of this stuff. I run Debian and KDE, and so I have
access to the katepart XML files in /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax. Thus, the keyword getter
strategies that use parser those files work for me.

If you know where these files are online, feel free to write a strategy implementation that gets
the file from the 'net and uses that (perhaps from KDE SVN?).

No real documentation I'm afraid... just look through the code and look at how the various keyword
strategy stuff is implemented in language/*/class.*getterstrategy.php.

Oh, and to use:

php get-keywords.php [lang] [group[
php get-keywords.php --list-langs
php get-keywords.php --list-groups [language]

In the future:

php get-keywords.php ... --output-format=[HTML|text|special]

     $Id$
