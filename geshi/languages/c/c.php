     * @note It might seem questionable at first whether declarator/type/
     * qualifier keywords, standard functions and standard macros or objects
     * will ever occur, thus requiring highlighting, within some preprocessor
     * directives - namely #(el)if, #ifdef, #ifndef and #undef.  They can and do
     * occur in practice though because these directives can be used to test
     * whether at preprocessor level the keyword, type or function in question
     * has been subverted (or for a function, whether it's been legitimately
     * defined as a macro), and/or to undo or change that subversion; for
     * #if/#elif, sizeof should be highlighted in any case - it's been
     * categorised as a standard function for GeSHi's purposes.
     *
     * For #(el)if, a type might also appear as the subject of sizeof.
     *
     * It's also debatable whether such tokens should be highlighted within
     * #error and #pragma directives - it seems most appropriate that they are
     * not, since within those directives their occurrence can be likened to
     * their appearance within a comment.  GeSHiCCodeParser::parseToken()
     * therefore adjusts those contexts; their highlighting when the parser is
     * disabled is tolerable as a minor glitch.
     *
     * It's less debatable that within a #include filename, these keywords
     * should not be highlighted.  That's handled in GeSHiCCodeParser::
     * parseToken() for <> includes - quoted includes are already protected by
     * the string_literal context (which parseToken() reclassifies).  It's
     * borderline tolerable that this incorrect highlighting will appear when
     * the parser is disabled.
     *
     * Within a #include where the filename is specified by a macro, the only
     * keywords that should be highlighted out of the list at the top of this
     * comment block are: standard macros (since they might be used in a
     * stringising macro "call"), any standard functions that are implementable
     * as macros (for the same reason), "sizeof" (since it might be used to
     * generate an argument for a macro "call") and types (but not qualifiers)
     * where they appear as the subject of sizeof.  The rest have no meaning in
     * preprocessor macro-"call" context.  Separating out "implementable-as-a-
     * macro" from the rest of the standard functions is a longer-term future
     * task to complete alongside comprehensively filling out what's missing
     * from the keyword lists.  Separating qualifiers from types is another task
     * to consider.  To start with, GeSHiCCodeParser::parseToken() disables
     * highlighting for the context 'declarator-keyword' within #include:s
     * where the filename is specified by a macro, and /all/ highlighting
     * is disabled for the macro name itself - i.e. highlighting applies only
     * to macro arguments.
     *
     * The same reasoning of the above paragraph can be applied to the #line
     * directive where its "arguments" are specified by a macro:
     * GeSHiCCodeParser::parseToken() similarly disables highlighting in that
     * situation.

     * directives and in fact in some they are illegal, but we assume well-
     * formed code so illegal occurrences need not concern us.
     *
     * In #(el)if directives, any symbol except the semicolon can legally occur.
     * At first it might seem that & has no place either since at preprocessing
     * stage no objects exist to take an address of, but & can also act as a
     * bitwise operator or be part of the logical && operator.  Due to the lack
     * of objects it might also at first seem that [] has no use, however it
     * can be applied to string literals for esoteric uses in a preprocessor
     * constant such as this expression equating to 1:
     * <code>"abcd"[1] == 'b'</code>.
     * A semicolon though is only used to end single statements in code -
     * this can't apply to a constant preprocessor expression.
     *
     * In #include and #line directives, the header filename and new effective
     * source file name (respectively) may be specified by a macro.  A macro
     * may take a constant preprocessor expression as an argument, so by this
     * reasoning we see that within #include and #line directives the same set
     * of symbols can occur as within an #(el)if directive - namely, anything
     * except a semicolon.
     *
     * In a #define, even a semicolon can occur since the macro can substitute
     * for code.
     *
     * #ifdef, #ifndef, #undef, #endif and #else do not allow any symbol except
     * by proxy for comments and line continuation slashes.
     *
     * Likewise for #error and #pragma except that any symbol could occur as
     * part of the subsequent (unquoted) freeform text.  These should not be
     * highlighted, and thus GeSHiCCodeParser::parseToken() recontextualises
     * them so that they aren't highlighted.  Their highlighting when the
