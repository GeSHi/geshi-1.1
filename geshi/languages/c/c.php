     * A preprocessing directive beginning with a # must occur at the start

     * optionally be followed by whitespace in the same manner, after which
     * the actual directive keyword is specified.  Finally though, a hash
     * without a following directive is allowed as a 'null directive'.
     *
     * There is also a single preprocessing directive (_Pragma) that follows
     * the same rules but is not preceded by a hash
     *
     * The list of non-newline whitespace characters recognised by C and
     * used in the r.e. below is: [ \t\f\v]
     *
     * The rule that lines may be continued by appending a trailing \ character
     * is no longer handled here because it added too much of a performance
     * penalty and because after disabling child preprocessor contexts (now a
     * permanent change) if we assume well-formed code it's unnecessary to
     * detect here.  The handling of line-continuation by trailing \ was in any
     * case incomplete - it didn't deal with e.g. a preprocessor directive
     * split in the middle.  The parseToken() member function of
     * GeSHiCCodeParser would need adjustment to handle that properly but
     * before implementing it specifically for C highlighting there may be some
     * generic functionality that we can implement to deal with it - see
     * bug #81.
     *
     * Currently the main problem with highlighting due to line-continuation by
     * backslash that can occur in well-formed code is when _Pragma is split -
     * the regex below will then miss it.  We could deal with that by
     * complicating the regex below but the performance implications would need
     * testing first.
     *
     * The lesser problem is that individual directives are not detected
     * within the parser when they have been split, meaning that the special-
     * case handling for the directive is not initiated.  As written above, that
     * could be handled by some logic in parseToken, but it may be preferable
     * for GeSHi's core to implement the generic preprocessing handling of
     * bug #81 instead.

     * @note It might seem questionable at first whether declarator/type/
     * qualifier keywords, standard functions and standard macros or objects
     * will ever occur, thus requiring highlighting, within some preprocessor
     * directives - namely #(el)if, #ifdef, #ifndef and #undef.  They can and do
     * occur in practice though because these directives can be used to test
     * whether at preprocessor level the keyword, type or function in question
     * has been subverted (or for a function, whether it's been legitimately
     * defined as a macro), and/or to undo or change that subversion; for
     * #if/#elif, sizeof should be highlighted in any case - it's been
     * categorised as a standard function for GeSHi's purposes.
     *
     * For #(el)if, a type might also appear as the subject of sizeof.
     *
     * It's also debatable whether such tokens should be highlighted within
     * #error and #pragma directives - it seems most appropriate that they are
     * not, since within those directives their occurrence can be likened to
     * their appearance within a comment.  This glitch can be resolved in the
     * parser; it's tolerable for it to appear when the parser is disabled.
     * @todo implement in the parser what's described in the above paragraph.
     *
     * It's less debatable that within a #include filename, these keywords
     * should not be highlighted.  That can be handled in the parser for <>
     * includes - quoted includes will already be protected by the
     * string_literal context.  It's borderline tolerable that this incorrect
     * highlighting will appear when the parser is disabled.
     * @todo implement in the parser what's described in the above paragraph.
     *
     * Within a #include where the filename is specified by a macro, the only
     * keywords that should be highlighted out of the list at the top of this
     * comment block are: standard macros (since they might be used in a
     * stringising macro "call"), any standard functions that are implementable
     * as macros (for the same reason), "sizeof" (since it might be used to
     * generate an argument for a macro "call") and types (but not qualifiers)
     * where they appear as the subject of sizeof.  The rest have no meaning in
     * preprocessor macro-"call" context.  Separating out "implementable-as-a-
     * macro" from the rest of the standard functions is a longer-term future
     * task to complete alongside comprehensively filling out what's missing
     * from the keyword lists.  Separating qualifiers from types is another task
     * to consider.  To start with, the parser should be used to disable
     * highlighting for the context 'declarator-keyword' within #include's
     * where the filename is specified by a macro, and /all/ highlighting
     * should be disabled for the macro name itself (with the possible
     * exception of any standard macros that resolve to a quoted string
     * constant - if any such macros even exist) - i.e. highlighting should
     * only apply to macro arguments.
     * @todo implement in the parser what's described in the above paragraph.
     *
     * The same reasoning of the above paragraph can be applied to the filename
     * of a #line.
     * @todo implement in the parser what's described in the above paragraph for
     * a #line directive.

     * stage no objects exist to take an address of, but & can also act as a
