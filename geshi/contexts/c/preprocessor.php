 * <code>
 * #define AMACRO(X) (X = my->define)
 * </code>
 * the first "define" - in #define - is linked and highlighted in the
 * 'preprocessor/directive' context and immediately afterwards the child
 * 'preprocessor/general' context kicks in so that the "define" of my->define
 * is no longer in the current 'preprocessor' context and won't be linked.
 *
 * This doesn't work for non-standard directives since they don't match a child
 * context: for those we instead return null for $data['url'] in
 * GeSHiCCodeParser->parseToken().
