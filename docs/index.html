<p>If you're reading this, thanks for helping test GeSHi 1.1! This is the brand-spanking new
version of GeSHi set to debut as GeSHi 1.2 whenever it's finished, and hopefully with your
help that time will be sooner rather than later. Perhaps before Duke Nukem Forever goes Gold
;)</p>

<p>Firstly, a warning: <strong>This code is ALPHA</strong>. At the time of me writing this
(2006/05/26), most of the 1.0.X API simply isn't implemented, I think only set_source,
set_language and parse_code are usable. As things progress more methods will be implemented,
but don't use this stuff as a drop-in replacement for GeSHi 1.0.X on a live site!
Furthermore, there may be security holes and the like in this code, so don't trust it
either.</p>

<p>That's all of the legal claptrap out of the way :). Now onto the goodies!</p>

<h2>Overview of GeSHi 1.1.X</h2>

<p>GeSHi 1.1.X is the current development branch of GeSHi. GeSHi follows Linux Kernel version
numbering, so 1.1.X is alpha while 1.2.X will be the stable version of this code. There's no
timeframe for a 1.2.0 release, and don't hold your breath either - as mentioned above, much
of the API still needs implementing. As of 2006/05/26, 1.1.X has been in development for
over a year and is still only at version 1.1.1.</p>

<p>Still, much of the actual highlighting code is in place, and it has undergone a radical
change. Whereas GeSHi 1.0.X was nothing more than a glorified string replacement engine,
1.1.X now is much closer to what a compiler would do in parsing a language, with detail
substituted for the ability of this engine to parse many languages. The upsides: the
highlighting is a million times better, you can embed languages within other languages, and
the infrastructure is in place for keen users to do all sorts of things - write mini
compilers, pull out user-defined functions and classes from the source and list them nicely
formatted, anything you like! The downside, as ever, will be speed and CPU usage. GeSHi is
not the lightest script to run. However, I plan to minimise load wherever possible, and
already 1.1.X benefits from using nearly no regular expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> (2006/05/26): In terms of parsing speed, 1.1.X seems to be slower
than 1.0.X. However, don't despair! There is still much to be done, and much chance for
optimisation and caching.</p>

<h2>Features planned for 1.2</h2>

<p>GeSHi 1.2 will be light-years ahead of GeSHi 1.0.X, and further ahead still from any
competition. These are the major planned features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>PEAR compliance <span style="color:#00c000;">(achieved)</span> (note that GeSHi will
    never make it into PEAR, as the GNU GPL is not a compatible license. Besides, PEAR
    already has a syntax highlighting solution).</li>
    <li>Majorly improved highlighting <span style="color:#00c000;">(achieved)</span></li>
    <li>Caching support <span style="color:red;">(to be done)</span></li>
    <li>Reduced CPU load, and increased speed for equivalent sources/configurations
    <span style="color:#df0;">(so far speed is good, but much optimisation is to come)
    </span></li>
    <li>Support for people to access the parsed source directly to do as they please with it
    <span style="color:#df0;">(partially implemented)</span></li>
    <li>Release into mainstream Linux distributions (debian, redhat) as installable package
    <span style="color:red;">(todo)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>1.2 is not numbered as 2.0 as the API will remain the same where possible. However, the
PEAR compliance goal means that all of the setter methods (set_source, set_language,
set_styles etc.) will become deprecated and will be replaced with PEAR-style named methods
(setStyles for example).</p>

<p>Note that at this time I'm not predicting a clean upgrade from 1.0.X to 1.2. Not only
are method names changing, but some features from 1.0.X will disappear and some methods
will not behave the same as before.</p>

<p>Here are some more notes about the main goals of GeSHi 1.2:</p>

<h3>Majorly improved highlighting</h3>

<p>Because GeSHi 1.0.X is nothing more than glorified string replacement, every now and then
it will fail to understand an obscure segment of code and fail completely. For example, there
is a well known bug where putting a &gt; inside an HTML comment will cause the comment to end
prematurely. This bug is <em>unsolvable</em> in 1.0.X, due to the way it works. However, 1.2
understands perfectly.</p>

<p>There are many issues with the way highlighting is done in 1.0.X, and so I concentrated on
a complete rewrite, using the knowledge I have learned from my time at university. With the
aid of concepts such as trees, GeSHi 1.2 now provides much better highlighting, that is
configurable on a far more fine-grained level. The trade-off, of course, is in complexity.
Instead of simply defining a big array to specify the language data, you have to write
at least two files, one full of functions that make API calls on an object, and the other
full of information about how to style the code. You may also have to write a
&quot;Code Parser&quot; - a class that takes tokens from the GeSHi engine as input and
can modify them on the fly.</p>

<p>Still, the benefits are great. You've probably seen the pages with PHP embedded in HTML,
with CSS and Javascript highlighting all in the same source, or perhaps you tried it for
yourself at <a href="http://geshi.org/">http://geshi.org/</a>. And, as long as I can find
authors for languages, highlighting for other languages will be just as good. Which brings me
to a point: <em>I can't maintain everything on my own anymore!</em> If you want to help out
with the GeSHi project, and have a good understanding of a programming language and think
you're up to the task of maintaining the language file(s) for that language, please
<a href="mailto:nigel@geshi.org">contact me</a>! Excluded languages are PHP, (X)HTML, CSS,
and possibly Javascript and Doxygen, because I like those languages too much ;). But if you
know any other language, perhaps SQL, XML, C++ (C is taken), Perl or similar, posts are
available :)</p>

<h3>Caching support</h3>

<p>I'll say it again: GeSHi is sloooooow. If you have a good server with a decent hunk of RAM
and you're only ever highlighting small chunks of source, you probably won't notice any
issues. But in ther circumstances, caching is a good idea. But why should I make everyone who
uses GeSHi write their own caching solution? So GeSHi 1.2.X will come with caching options to
speed things up. The plan is that the caching will support multiple backends, like the
filesystem and memcached. It will be quite configurable so you won't have to worry about its
size running away on you.</p>

<p>You'll also benefit from a script cacher such as PHPAccelarator or Turck-MMCache because of
the size of the scripts, although many people won't have access to such things.</p>

<h3>Reduced CPU load/increased speed</h3>

<p>This will be achieved because 1.2 won't use regular expressions to parse code, however I
don't think there will be a large improvement. I have been testing GeSHi using a language
that was deliberately as complicated as they come (HTML with CSS, Javascript and PHP all in
one as part of the "PHP" language is *huge* compared with most languages), so I haven't
really tried it with a smaller language like SQL/QBasic or similar. Speed will again be an
issue - for small sources the context tree still has to be loaded, which will be a large
overhead, larger in fact than actually parsing the source, but it will scale well to larger
pieces of source. Caching will help in this regard.</p>

<h3>Access to the parsed source</h3>

<p>What 1.1 currently does is use the context tree to parse the source. While the source
is being parsed, when a new token is discovered, it is handed on to the Code Parser mentioned
above, so it can be modified as necessary, and then it is passed to a Renderer for adding
to the result.</p>

<p>But, what if access was given to the tokens when they were discovered? Then people could
use it to check all sorts of things - for example, if there was a php/php/keyword index with
the contents &quot;function&quot;, then the next index would hold the name of a user-defined
function or method. With a bit of time and effort, the possibilities could be endless! You
could (as in the example) pull out all the functions in the source, find all the defined
variables, even look for parse errors.</p>

<h3>Release into mainstream Linux distributions</h3>

<p>This would make GeSHi available on a larger scale, as well as introduce me to how program
releases are made in the open-source world. However, I am looking for someone to help with
this - if you have experience in releasing programs for Debian, Redhat etc. and you want to
help then please <a href="mailto:nigel@geshi.org">contact me</a>.</p>

<h2>Using/Testing GeSHi 1.1.X</h2>

<p>If you have the source to a build of 1.1.X (which I assume you do if you're reading this),
then test away! API documentation is included in the docs/api/ directory of each build so you
can use that to have an idea of what is currently supported, though there's no guarantee that
the documentation is correct, and no better reference than the source code.</p>

<p>If a method is publically available, test it until it bleeds, and e-mail me at
<a href="nigel@geshi.org">nigel@geshi.org</a> if you find a bug. You're welcome to propose a
patch or solution to the bug as well.</p>

<p>However, for larger bugs, including feature ideas and implementations of the current API, <em>it is very
unlikely that I will accept code</em>. I have a definite idea of how GeSHi 1.2 is going to work and how many
of the old API methods will be implemented, I just haven't coded them yet. Still, your suggestions are welcome
and &quot;votes&quot; for methods to implement will be considered ;)</p>

<h2>The source</h2>

<p>Is a mess. There may be conflicting/dead comments, errant whitespace, useless code and
todos about me needing a haircut in there, please wear your safety firewall before
inspecting. If you see an algorithm in the source that you can improve, by all means send me
a patch. If you break up some of the complicated bits into easier to read bits, send me a
patch (especially if it has helpful comments explaining how stuff works!)</p>

<hr />

<p>That's all I can think of right now. Thanks for reading this document!</p>
